# Assignment 2 â€” Cybersecurity Prototype

This repository is a ready-to-upload GitHub project demonstrating prototype implementations for an assignment based on the chosen research paper.

Modules included (toy / prototype implementations):
- multi_agent_trust/: simulates agents, interactions, and trust score updates with attack scenarios.
- blockchain_ledger/: minimal blockchain implementation for verification of audit logs and actions.
- dynamic_isolation/: simulated dynamic isolation manager that "isolates" malicious agents or tasks.
- benchmark/: scripts to benchmark core operations (trust updates, block creation, isolation actions).
- docs/: documentation and design notes.
- examples/: example runs and sample outputs.
- requirements.txt, LICENSE, and instructions to run locally.

Important: These are educational, simplified prototypes meant to be extended for production use.
See docs/ for details, design rationale, and extension ideas.

Quick start:
1. Create Python venv (Python 3.10+ recommended):
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows PowerShell
2. Install deps:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Generate data and run demos:
   python examples/run_all.py
4. Run benchmarks (example):
   python benchmark/run_benchmarks.py --out results/benchmarks.json

Push this folder to GitHub as your project repository.
